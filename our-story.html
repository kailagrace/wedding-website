    <h4>HOW THEY MET</h4>
    <h5>Kaila Says</h5>
    <p>Billy and I met the August after my Freshman year at UConn. I was a new hire in the University's Outdoors Program, and Billy was the manager at the time. The first time I laid eyes on him, we were asked to start a "staff bonding activity," where we each told the group something about ourselves that was unique. Billy's fact was that he converted a schoolbus and painted it patriotic colors, in order to road trip across the United States. Mine was that I had thirteen grandparents. I remembered him as the handsome, tall, fellow with a really bizarre fun fact. </p>
    <p>
    Obviously, my fact was memorable too because he used it to start our first conversation later on. We hit it off immediately. Staff training was a week long, but Billy was only at training for two days, so when he left I had a few more days left, enough to wish he were still there! We continued to see each other through work, and Billy asked me on our first official date that following week. </p>

    <h4>HOW THEY FELL IN LOVE</h4>
    <h5>Kaila Says</h5>
    <p>It wasn't hard to fall in love with Billy. He took me on a dream first date- the kind that seems too good to be true. We went to the drive-in movies in his pickup truck. I'd prepared by bringing a picnic basket with chocolate milk, which he said he liked, and popcorn, etc. Little did I know he already had a cooler filled to the brim with food and drinks. That was the first indicator I had of how much Billy had it together- he was adventurous and exciting, but always prepared.</p><p>Most of what I remember from that date was that I paid no attention to the movie. We had a chemistry I had never felt with anyone before, and I just liked talking to him, being near him. Both of the films finished, and we decided to drive back and hang out for a while more, just because we didn't want the night to end.</p>Fast forward a few weeks, several trips with the mountain biking team, an RV trip in his patriotic schoolbus with our work friends, and a harvest festival in his hometown, and I had fallen for him one hundred and ten percent.</p>

    <h4>MEMORABLE MOMENT FROM OUR RELATIONSHIP</h4>
    <h5>Kaila Says</h5>
    <p>The road trip, for me, was a huge one. Billy and I first took our relationship to the road the summer after we met. Billy's parents were kind enough to loan us their minivan, and we went on a road trip across the country. We started in Connecticut, went southwest to Utah/Arizona/Colorado, and then made our way up the west coast all the way to Vancouver, Canada. On the way back, we spent a long time in Canada, but also jaunted down to Montana and back to Niagara Falls. If you're interested in reading more about our time on the road, or just want to get to know us as a couple, check out <a href="https://whereverthetrailleadsus.wordpress.com/tag/darlings-living-the-dash/"> our blog from the trip.</a> It's a fun read, if we do say so ourselves.</p>

     <h4>FUNNY MOMENT FROM OUR RELATIONSHIP</h4>
    <h5>Kaila Says</h5>
    <p>There have been so many funny moments with Billy. One of my favorites was when we decided to make a cake together for a cycling team race. Billy had always wanted to make a cake shaped like a Tonka truck (why, I have no idea!), so <a href="">we did</a> </p>
